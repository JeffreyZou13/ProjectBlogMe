Instructions
------------
To register for an account, click on "Log In" in the upper right corner. At the bottom of the Log In page will be a link to "Create New Account". This will direct you to the Register page, where you can add a new user account to the site. Passwords need to be at least 6 characters. You can also enter an email address, where a recovery password will be emailed to you if you forget your password. You can reset your password through the "Forget Password?" link on the Log In page.

Once you've logged in, you will be directed to your profile page. This page lists links to all of the posts you have made and the dates they were created. You can always return to this page through the "My Profile" link in the navigation bar. Each user has a unique profile page listing their posts. On the About page, there is an alphabetically ordered list of all user profiles on Stuy Bytes. 

To create a new post, click on the "New Post" link in the navigation bar. You will be able to enter a title and post text. Once you hit "Submit", you will be directed to a page that displays the post and its title, author, date created, time created, and comments. You can delete a post you've created with the "Delete Post" link on the bottom right corner of the post text. You can also click on the post author's name to be directed to their profile page. 

To add a comment to a post, use the labeled space below the post text. When you hit submit, the comment text and its author, date created, and time created will display in the list of comments below. You can click on the comment author's name to be directed to their profile page.

If you are logged in, the Log In page will display a link to log out. Once you are logged out, you can still see user profiles and posts, but you can no longer add you own posts or comments.
